# Olist Churn Analysis & BI Dashboard


This repository contains the data, source code, and reporting assets for the Olist customer churn and retention analysis. The project leverages cleaned ecommerce datasets to build a comprehensive Power BI dashboard and deliver actionable business insights focusing on customer churn, revenue trends, delivery performance, and product category analysis.

The dataset was sourced from the [Brazilian Ecommerce Public Dataset by Olist](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce?resource=download) on Kaggle.

## Setup & Usage

1. **Install dependencies:**

    Note: There is currently no `requirements.txt` file included. Please ensure required Python packages (such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, etc.) are installed manually or create this file as needed.
    ```

2. **Run analysis pipeline:**

    The `main.py` script performs data loading, cleaning, feature engineering, and generates output files for Power BI import.

    python src/main.py
    ```

3. **Power BI Dashboard:**

    - Import the cleaned `.csv` files generated by the pipeline into Power BI Desktop.
    - Load the DAX measures and relationships as configured in the project.
