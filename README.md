## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🧑‍🏫 AI-Driven Market Intelligence Platform (2025)
**Technologies:** Python, LangChain, Ollama (LLaMA3), ChromaDB, Streamlit  
A modular platform built using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to generate contextual insights from internal business or market data. It ingests documents (scraped web data, CSVs), embeds them using Sentence Transformers, stores vectors in ChromaDB, and serves contextual answers via Llama3 using Ollama. The app features a Streamlit interface for querying and real-time market research.

> 🔍 Future Scope: Multi-source live ingestion (news, social feeds), user-level personalization, advanced analytics (trend detection), cloud deployment with authentication.

### 🧬 LLM Benchmarking for Cell Type Annotation (May–Sep 2024)
**Technologies:** Python, HuggingFace, TensorFlow, Kani, HPC, Scanpy  
Benchmarked open-source LLMs to automate cell type annotation in single-cell RNA-seq data. Integrated models into a benchmarking pipeline and evaluated across 100K+ biomedical records. Identified optimal LLM with 82% accuracy and reduced manual labor by 30%.

---

### 📈 Hierarchical Sales Forecasting with Explainable AI (Jun 2025)
**Technologies:** LightGBM, SHAP, Pandas  
Generated daily forecasts at multiple levels (state → store → product) with LightGBM. Engineered time and event features and visualized SHAP values to explain 100K+ predictions. Improved RMSE by 18% and uncovered key drivers like sell price and seasonality.

---

### 🐦 Tweet Sentiment Analyzer (Apr 2025)
**Technologies:** Python, Tweepy, Streamlit, TextBlob, Logistic Regression  
Built a real-time sentiment analyzer for Twitter data using custom keyword filters. Achieved 89% classification accuracy and visualized results on a responsive Streamlit dashboard.

---

### 👤 Gender Classification using ML (Mar 2025)
**Technologies:** Scikit-learn, SVM, k-NN, Decision Tree  
Trained ML classifiers on 3,000+ human body measurements to predict gender. Evaluated with cross-validation and achieved a best F1-score of 0.91 using SVM, outperforming baseline models.
